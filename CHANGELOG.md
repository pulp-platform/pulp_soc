## [2.0.0] - 2020-12-11
### Added
- Completely replaced `soc_interconnect` with a new parametric version
- Added AXI Crossbar to `soc_interconnect` to attach custom IPs
- Added new `pulp_soc` parameter to isolate the axi plug CDC fifo in case it is not needed
- Add `register_interface` as dependency to simplify integration of custom ip using reggen
- Properly assert `r_opc` signal in new interconnect to indicate bus errors
- Add error checking for illegal access on HWPE ports which only have access to L2 interleaved memory
### Changed
- AXI ID width of cluster plugs are now set to actually required width instead of a hardcoded one
- TCDM protocol to SRAM specific protocol is moved from interconnect to memory bank module
### Removed
- obsolete `axi_node` dependency
